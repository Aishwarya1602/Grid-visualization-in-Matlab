"# Grid-visualization-in-Matlab" 
The present files provide a visual confuguration of power system and component. So far, grid buses and lines, generic alternator, wind tower, photovoltaics and active load have been included. Grid of interest is being defined whithin excel files as desired< one basically has to define nodes in Node.xlsx file then determine line connection in 'Branches.xlsx' by ending and sending nodes.
